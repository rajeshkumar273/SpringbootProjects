Intro
======

User wants reporting porta to understand what all transactions for last month or an month.

Example 
======

Atos is having one corporate ID i.e., CID and atos will be having one PA, Who will be reporting porgramme administrator of that organization.

If any issue is happending with some of the templates. They will be to going to CPPs. (Customer Care Professionals)

CCP's will come and raise the INC's for us.

I want statement of the last month. What are all transactions happended so I feel like this tranctions not happend. so at that time that might PA) we will go ccp and this transaction is not happended.

Then CCP's, They will raise incident with details.

Greg
====
The main purpose is to maintain individuals for corporate services.

All access & permissions will be given in GREG.

GIDM - Global information delivery management
=============================================

GIDM is used to setup for client profile, report related information will be there at the organizaion level.

We can see the report setup on GIDM screen based permissions.

If you have online permissions you will have BTA statements. in this you need control accounts or card account anything is required.

CID - 9 digits ( 3 digits market and 6 digits market code)
Card account 15 digits
GUID - 16 digits

When you cick on submit, it will interact with GCCP database and GDR database.

GCCP db fetch from contro accounts details and it will validate whether the profile is having control account linkage & few validation.

GDR DB fetches from card account details like transaction data.

OU - BU - Reporting Group - CID - MCA - ICA - BCA - Card accounts.

CID concept will be there in all the application.

OU & BU Concept will be there in GIDM.

GIDM moved to AuthBlue version. Till it was supported by SSO.

Reason: 
======
	Business want Auth version. (Without credentials once you logged in)
	Greg and GIDM Auth versions.
	
	
Japan BTA statements - OS60001 -- which came in recently for Japan market users.

My Data:
=======
A few of the templates were moved from GIDM to MyDATA.

How my-data is disabing this GR templates
=========================================
They were not deploying the code. They are diable the template in GIDM and make it enable in my data end. They are just doing vault-configuration changes.

and restarting the pod in both POD & POA projects


What difference blw BU & reporting BU
=====================================

BU --> BU Can have only CID's attached it.
==

Reporting BU --> Reporting BU can have CID's or all control accounts are attached it.
============


SAN
===

SAN is a File Mounted system.

In CIW, we have pdf and excel format. From where it is coming means SAN.

SAN is a File Server System that all the CIW and reporting will be available.

How it creates folders
======================

It will create floder structure based on primary market of the user and depend on Contact ID. It will be unique to everyone.

My fies will go & upload in SAN location. When I go to CIW, to view files it will available.

SAN access denied, given by CIW ETL will provide SAN path to the user.


Recipient Maintenance
=====================
The OU & BU ID information will be sink with RMF system. Green system (GIS central team have that green system.)

OU, BU and Recipient ID these three information will be coming from RMF - database and it wil retrival or viewable at GIDM end.

GDR,GCCP and mainframe - These are three interfacing teams for GIDM which we use.

Main tables
===========

For creating report-setup that table which we use GIDM end is 1360 & 1361.

--> CID or any control account details required then 1870 (client group table is require).

1360 & 1361 --> report version tables

Which is required for report setup.


Cycle - 9 
=========
I have created report set-up for cycle-cut 9. so by the next month/ cycle-9 depending on delivery method.

MSSU ETL 
========
It will Scan any data required for cycle-9 and 1360 & 1361 table. they will pick all the data they will start picking entry and created RRID's (report request id's)


IBI - Information builder INC
=============================
IBI is a batch reporting, where statements and reports were being delivery in batch like every month and quater based on the frequery of the user selection.

RusGovernor, start getting request ID. They wil start processing this request.

How they process in IBI
=======================

They will check whether it is pdf or xls required. depending on that they will take the data from GDR and prepare the sheet.

Once sheet is done, they will be pushing it to SAN.

If the entry is available in SAN then user is able to view the statement.

rpt-req_chk 
rpt_req_arch

Who will be pushing it be SAN
=============================== 
CIW ETL will be pusing it to SAN.


Same process happending for standard reporting also.

pushing it SAN reporting end they start viewing the reports.

Available reports, in this category they will start viewing the reports. once report is ready in SAN.


Reporting API
=============
Reporting API, is the API which will used to upoad & download the file.


Once process is done at IBI end. Reporting API push it to SAN.

Reporting API picks from SAN.


---> Standard reports we are pulling from CIW database, throught reporting API.

GMIP Homepage
=============

GMIP is go live with interaction of GCCP DB, 

What is contact id 
What is recipient id
What is web user ID


It it correct or not will take the data from 1077 table.

Contact table will give the data.

CIW, whenever user is accessing reports when click on table.

web_trans_table  -- 120-day deactivation rule.

Report setup will be deactivated, if user is not accessing more than 120 days.

select file_name, insert_ts from TCLID01.CIW_WEB_TRANS_STAGING where recip_id='1120219' and file_name like '%GR-2016%'


Basic table of CIW is "DFF_user"

GCCP contact table information will available in 1077 table.

For standard_reporting
======================
RPT_Req
RPT_LIST

GMIP Landing page will ave interaction with GCCP database, CIW database.

Hierarachy page will have interaction with prefetch database

From where reports are coming that will come GDR database.

Any of template data, you wil get data from GDR database.


User (Profile) information wil come from GCCP and transaction will come GDR database.

Tables
------
1.Recipient_Access_Hierarachy 
2.Card_account table
3. Client_group table


Depending on report query will change.

I am using Card member report, I will have different report setup.

Issue only we taking the query and we analyize the data.

How the report generate
----------------------

The report will get generate from GDR, MSTR developer tool will make it in a human readable format.

(Like report viewable format)

IBI is tool, make it a fashion to the report. Like that MSTR is another tool whic is make it human readable format.

MSTR developer tool
===================

It is help us to fetch data from GDR end, Like attributes.

Micro-strategy or reporting tool components have specific engines to generate SQL statements & to do calcuations & to do message queuing priorization jobs and exectuting in manner and get it sequence those kind stuff.

servers
=======





 
How the issue is cirmenting after restart server
================================================

MSTR is not a small appication. It is fetching the data in laksh so sometimes they are just clearing cache in order to make it clear in a proper formation. 

It just clearning like any memory issues (out_of_memory_exceptions) in order to have the memory issues we are restarting ther servers.
