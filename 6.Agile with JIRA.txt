Agile with JIRA
=================

=> SDLC means software development life cycle

=> SDLC represents the process of software project development from starting to ending.

=> SDLC contains several phases

	- Requirements Gathering
	- Requirements Analysis
	- Designing
	- Development
	- Testing
	- Deployment
	- Support

=> In SDLC several methodologies

		a) waterfall (outdated)
		b) agile (trending)

================
Waterfall Model	
================

=> It is linear model / Sequential model

=> Work will be completed step by step

=> After one stage completed then only move to next stage

=> It supports only forward direction

=> Requirements fixed & budget fixed

=> Client involment is very less 

=> Client will see project only at the end

=> If client is not happy with project then money will be wasted and time will be wasted.

##### To overcome challenges of waterfall model, industry is using Agile Model now a days #####

==============
Agile Model
==============

=> Agile is an iterative approach to develop and deliver software applications to client.

=> In Agile model (planning + development + testing + deployment ) is a continuos process.

=> Project functionalitiy will be divided into multiple sprints/releases.

Ex: Client has given 100 requirements

	Sprint-1 : 30 requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-2 : 30 requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-3 : 30 requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)

	Sprint-4 : 10 requirements (plan + develop + test + deliver + take feedback)


=> Client feedback is very important/critical is Agile model.

=> Client involvement is also high in agile model.

=> Requirements & Budget is not fixed in Agile.

============
Agile Team
============

1) Product Owner  : Responsible for client deliverables.

2) Scrum Master : Responsible to manage the agile team.

		- Manage JIRA
		- Assign the tasks in JIRA
		- Follow up the work status with team
		- Identify issues in team

3) Tech Lead : Responsible for solving technical challenges.

4) Team members : developers + testers 

Note: Industry standard agile team size is 7 to 10 only.

=> One project can have multiple agile teams also.

=> Every agile team will have one tech lead & one scrum master.


==================
Agile Terminology
==================

1) Backlog Grooming

2) Story & Story Points

3) Sprint Planning

4) Sprint

5) Scrum

6) Retrospective



=> Backlog grooming is a meeting in which we will discuss pending works in the project.

=> For every pending work, one story will be created in jira. All team members can create stories in JIRA Backlog.

=> For every story we will assign story points.

=> Story points represents duration to complete the story.

			1 day  -> 3 points

			2 days -> 5 points

			3 days -> 8 points

=> Sprint Planning is a meeting in which we will discuss about priority stories to complete.	

Note: Industry standard for sprint duration is 2 weeks of time.

=> Sprint means fixed set of stories targeted to be completed in sprint duration.

=> During sprint, every day scrum call will be there.

=> Scrum call is a meeting in which we will discuss agile team work updates.

			1) What i am doing today (story detail)
			2) When my story will be completed
			3) Any challenges i am facing to complete

Note: Every team member should give above updates to scrum master in scrum call on daily basis.

Note: If you are not available to join scrum then send your work updates to the scrum master in email.

=> Retrospective is a meeting in which agile team will discuss about prevous sprints.

=> Retro is like a review meeting. in retro we will discuss

		- what went well
		- what went wrong
		- lessons learnt
		- new ideas

Note: Retro happens monthly once.

==============================
JIRA (Project Mgmt Software)
==============================

=> JIRA S/w developed by Atlasian company.

=> JIRA is a commercial software (we can use trial version).

=> JIRA is used as project mgmt s/w...

		- create stories for pending works
		- assign stories to team members
		- change story status
		- sprint reports
		- project tracking
		- bug reporting
