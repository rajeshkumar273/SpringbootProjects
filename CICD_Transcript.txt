What is CI/CD ?
CI/CD is a design practice used to:

Automate and improve the process of software delivery
Allow software to be developed to a higher standard and easily packaged and deployed to test and production environments

Why is CI/CD important ?
CI/CD results in the ability to rapidly and repeatedly push out new features and enhancements or bug fixes with minimal manual overhead. 
CI/CD pipeline helps automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a staging or production environment.

Remove manual errors, provide standardized development feedback loops and enable fast product iterations.


Approach

Continuous Integration
**********************
Developers merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible.
Changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.
Analysis run against the code to find bugs, vulnerabilities etc.


Continuous Delivery
*******************
An extension of continuous integration to make sure that new changes can be released quickly in a sustainable way.
Automates the release process and can deploy an application at any point of time by clicking on a button.

Continuous Deployment
*********************
Deployment pipelines are triggered automatically for every change.
Automated functional/regression tests run on the deployed application in QA Environments.
Ability to rollback in a single click if the application doesn't pass validations.
Realtime application monitoring and alerts.

CI/CD Pipeline
**************
Automate steps in the software delivery process such as initiating code builds, running automated tests & deploying to a staging or production environment.
eCP CI/CD uses XL Release or CI Pipeline as orchestrators.
